This is an assignment of the course Computer Organisation at IIIT Delhi. It contains Level-1 &amp; Level-2 Cache Memory which allows loading and searching using Direct Mapping, Fully Associative Mapping &amp; Set Associative Mapping
Cache Assignment

A cache of size S with CL as the number of cache lines and block size B is to be built. S, CL, and B are in powers of 2. Write a program that allows loading into cache and searching cache using:
Direct mapping 
Associative memory
n-way set associative memory where n is a power of 2.
Any programming language (of your choice) can be used. 

Build a 2 level cache. The size of the level 1 cache is S/2 and the size of level 2 cache is S. All the other parameters are to be decided accordingly. This will also be a standalone cache without the intervention of the main memory.
